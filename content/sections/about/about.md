I have acquired over 20 years of software development and engineering leadership experience in a variety of development environments and platforms. I have a wealth of knowledge in scaling web applications and the entire software development lifecycle.

My expertise is in backend application development, specifically Java/Spring Boot, NodeJS, and LAMP stack, along with frontend frameworks such as Angular and React.

In addition to my technical skills I have a wide range of skills developed through the years in planning, design, and managing software engineering teams.  Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/en/charlescampbell) profile for more details about my experience.

In addition, I have experience being a Technical Co-founder of a startup called [Socialvest](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/socialvest), which raised $1.7M in VC funding and resulted in a successful exit.

I am also concerned with bridging the digital divide with technology integration and technical skills development in underserved communities. I believe its important to pull others up as we continue to climb onward and upward.
