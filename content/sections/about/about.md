I am the husband to a beautiful wife of 15 yrs, father to 3 amazing kids and the official dog walker for our pandemic pup Hope.

When people ask me where am I from, it always turns into a long story because I grew up a military brat as my father was in the Air Force. I was born in Chicago, then moved to Utah when I was 2 yrs old and lived there until we moved to Spain. I lived in Spain for about 5 years then moved to Pemberton, New Jersey where I did middle school and high school. Long story short, I tell everybody I'm from South Jersey (Exit 7 off the turnpike).

Professionally, I received my BS in Computer Science at [UNC Chapel Hill](https://cs.unc.edu/), my MS in Management of IT from the [McIntire School of Commerce](https://www.commerce.virginia.edu/) at UVA and my MBA from [Kenan-Flagler Business School](https://www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/). In addition, I have acquired over 20 years of software development and engineering leadership experience in a variety of development environments and platforms. I have a wealth of knowledge in scaling web applications and the entire software development lifecycle.

My expertise is in engineering leadership, backend application development with tech stacks such as Java/Spring Boot, NodeJS, and LAMP stack, the AWS cloud hosting environment, along with frontend frameworks such as Angular and React.

In addition to my technical skills I have a wide range of skills developed through the years in planning, design, and managing software engineering teams.  Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/en/charlescampbell) profile for more details about my professional experience.

Moreover, I have experience being a Technical Co-founder of a startup called [Socialvest](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/socialvest), in which we raised $1.7M in VC funding and resulted in a successful [exit](https://richmond.com/business/plang-acquires-atlanta-based-socialvest/article_79f1461c-9364-11e3-927b-0017a43b2370.html).

Lastly, I'm concerned with bridging the digital divide with technical skills development and financial literacy development in underserved communities. I believe it's important to pull others up as we continue to climb onward and upward.
